RDD - Resilient Distributed Datasets. Imutable and fault tolerant

A Dataset is a strongly-typed, immutable collection of objects that are mapped to a relational schema.  

At the core of the Dataset API is a new concept called an encoder, which is responsible for converting between JVM objects and tabular representation. 
The tabular representation is stored using Spark’s internal Tungsten binary format, allowing for operations on serialized data and improved memory utilization.
